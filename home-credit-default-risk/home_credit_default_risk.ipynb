    "Repaid loans (0) compared to not repaid loans (1) shows us that, *there are far more repaid loans than not repaid loans*. Most machine learning algorithms work best when the number of classes are roughly equal. This is called the *class imbalance problem*. We want to emphasize to the machine learning algorithm that it's important to detect the few cases where a loan is likely not to be repaid, rather than focusing only on high accuracy."
